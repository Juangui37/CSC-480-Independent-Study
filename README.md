## Introduction
For someone, like myself, who just recently became an unexpected father,looking into buying a home can be a daunting thing to think about. The housing market is already complex and difficult to navigate, especially for first-time homebuyers. This project aims to use data science to make informed decisions when buying a house. The overall objective of this project is to hone and improve my data related skills to prepare for my upcoming internship, while also learning insights and information about the housing market.

## Project Details

This project will focus on the following:

- [ ] Web scraping Zillow's website using Python's Beautiful Soup library
- [ ] Creating & familiarizing myself with the 2 type of databases databases (SQL and NoSQL) to store housing information
- [ ] Using Python libraries (pandas, matlibplot, NumPy,etc....) to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the variables
- [ ] Using supervised data science models (regression and classification) to gain insights into the data
- [ ] Automating the project through data pipelines

## Timeline
The project will be completed over a series of weeks. The timeline for each step is as follows:

- [ ] February 22nd: Step 1: Web scraping
- [ ] March 8th: Step 2: Database creation
- [ ] March 29th: Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
- [ ] April 12th: Step 4: Model creation
- [ ] April 26th: Automation using pipelines
