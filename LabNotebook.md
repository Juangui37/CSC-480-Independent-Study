# CSC 480 Lab Notebook/Journal


## 2/27/23

Today, I went through some of Dr. Dancik's videos from his CSC-301-01 Adv Web Develop & Scraping class.

More specifically I watched:

This video talks about the ethics of webscraping, the robots.txt of websites, and it shows of two examples of webscraping: Wetather.com and Easterns Major website
This video also showed how to turn the extracted data from weather.com into a dataframe in which he created a barplot to see what day of the week would have the hottest day.
I followed along in both videos and part of the 'Weather Scraper' python notebook did not work. The notebook did not return the day of the week. This can either be because I'm using safari or because the page has updated.
I fixed this by going on the website the notebook provided, inspecting the page and looking to see what type of tag the day of the week had. The tag was different than in the notebook. The notebook showed a H2 (header 2?) but my safari site showed an H3. I changed the tag from H2 to H3 on the notebook and it worked properly.

This video shows how to install selenium onto a desired web browser and then it shows a couple of examples of how Selenium can be used to automate and interact with other web browsers. I didn't fully follow along with the Selenium notebook because I have a macbook and don't know what the equivalent of XPath is.
