Today, I went through some of Dr. Dancik's videos from his CSC-301-01 Adv Web Develop & Scraping class.

More specifically I watched:

- Monday, March 21, 2022 at 10:02:32 AM: 
-   This video talks about the ethics of webscraping, the robots.txt of websites, and it shows of two examples of webscraping. Dr. Dancik Webscraped from Wetather. and Easterns Major website
-   He also showed how to turn the extracted data from weather.com into a dataframe in which he created a barplot to see what day of the week would have the hottest day.
-   I followed along in both videos and part of the the 'Weather Scraper' python notebook did not work. The part that did not work was  that it did not return the day of the week. This can either be because I'm using safari or because the page has updated.
-   I fixed this by going on the website on this notebook, inspecting the page and looking to see what type of tag the day of the week had. The tag was different than what Dr. dancik had. Dr. D's browser showed a H2 (header 2?) tag while mine showed a H3 tag.
